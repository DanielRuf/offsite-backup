# offsite-backup
scripts (batch and bash) to create an offsite backup of a website (database and files) over SSH

plink.exe and pscp.exe are needed on Windows. You can get them from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html.


## Mac OS
For Mac OS please use `backup_mac.sh` and install `sshpass`.  

You can install it also with homebrew with the following command:  

`brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass`


You can always change the script as needed, switch to SSH key based authentication and remove the password parameters and you can freely extend it.
